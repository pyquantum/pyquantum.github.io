# Installation
In the terminal enter the following commands (you just need `git` and `python` installed). If you do not have git installed, just download the folder from Github and run the `setup.py` file with python. Please install `cython`, `numpy`, `scipy` and `qutip` as `piqs` depends on these packages.

We will soon publish the code in the Python Packaging Index (`pip`) and also make a `conda` package for easy installation on Windows. If you have any problems installing the tool, please open an issue or write to us.
```
git clone https://github.com/nathanshammah/piqs.git
cd piqs
python setup.py install
```
